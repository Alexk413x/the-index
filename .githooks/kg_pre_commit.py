"""codebase-kg staleness check over the STAGED change set. Advisory.

The same questions `kg_pre_push.py` asks, asked one step earlier: does this
change touch source no node covers, delete source the graph still anchors on, or
rewrite a mapped file past the digest its description was written against?
Finding out at commit is worth more than finding out at push, because the commit
that needs the graph update is still the one in front of you.

Digests come from the index (`:path`), not the working tree — the staged bytes
are what the commit will contain, and they are what the comparison has to use.

It does NOT refresh anything, and cannot. `/codebase-kg:refresh` maps changed
files to nodes, hands a JSON diff to a person to read, and decides what to add,
edit or remove -- judgement a shell hook has no way to make. Automating the
CHECK is the honest half; automating the fix would mean writing whatever the
hook guessed into the graph and calling it knowledge.

Everything is imported from `kg_pre_push.py` beside it rather than copied, so
there is one implementation of the coverage rule and only one file to keep in
step with `codebase_kg/coverage.py`.

It also closes a blind spot in the push-time check. That one compares against
the upstream branch, so once you have pushed it reports nothing -- which is
exactly when someone thinks to look. Staged-against-HEAD is always the right
comparison, whatever has been pushed.

On top of the staged report it prints ONE line with the repo-wide staleness
total when that is non-zero. Change-set scoping is correct here and must not
become noisy, so the standing backlog gets a line and nothing more; the push
hook is where it is argued with. Without that line the backlog is invisible at
both hooks, which is how one repo accumulated 47 stale files unnoticed.

It stays advisory. Exit status is always 0.

Skip with `SKIP_KG=1`, or `git commit --no-verify` to skip every hook.
